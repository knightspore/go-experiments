# Voronoi In Go

A simple voronoi image generator written in Go using only the standard library.

## Usage

To create a simple image, open main.go and change the `NUM_POINTS`, `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` to your liking.

```bash
go build .
open image.png
```

There is also a shader version (`voronoi.frag`) which you can view by pasting it [into the editor here](https://thebookofshaders.com/edit.php).
